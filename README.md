# Portafolio

Hi!

This is a portafolio for my work in Machine Learning. It currently comprises two main projects. The first one has to do with soccer statistics and the second one deals with finance applications. 

For the first project, I have done work in a couple of datasets. The first one is a record of FIFA rankings over time for men's national teams. I created some plots to explore what country has been more dominating in the time period explored by the dataset. 
The second one contains statistics for soccer matches from the MLS. It tried a couple of regression and classification tasks around the score of the match based on other metrics such as possession and shots. 

For the second project, I used a dataset that contains yearly finantial information about different firms including revenues, investment and profits, as well as the behavior of the corresponding stock year to year. The goal is to predict the latter based on the former. I trained some neural networks to perform regression and classification.

I hope you find this portafolio interesting, 

Nicolas
